# hello-world 

I'm Alex, a multimedia padawan from Milwaukie, Oregon. I love to make music, read, write, and anything to do with cameras. I'm very interested in web-development but have very little experience. I know the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, but I'd like to expand that knowledge and create things that help people.
